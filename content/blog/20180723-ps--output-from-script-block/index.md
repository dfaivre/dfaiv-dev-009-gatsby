I have a Powershell deploy script that runs multiple background tasks in parallel using a [script block](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_script_blocks?view=powershell-7.1). The block was using `Write-Host` but I wasn't getting any output. Turns out I needed to use `Receive-Job` to capture any output.

```powershell
# helper to log results
function _handleJobResults {
    Write-Host "listing all jobs"
    Get-Job

    Write-Host "resetting jobs"
    Get-Job | Remove-Job
}

function _waitForJobs {
    # should really check that jobs have finished, maybe in another post.
    Write-Host "waiting for jobs to finish"
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
}

$jobCount = 3

# function block to be invoked in background job.
$_deployBlock01 = {
    param($_i)
    Write-Host "script block output: $_i"
}

# invoke background jobs
# no Write-Host output from $_deployBlock01
foreach ($i in 1..$jobCount) {
    Start-Job -ScriptBlock $_deployBlock01 -Name "test-job-$i" -ArgumentList $i
}

_waitForJobs
_handleJobResults
Write-Host "no output from script block should have been logged."

Write-Host "re-run jobs, capture output"
# invoke background jobs, capture outputs
foreach ($i in 1..$jobCount) {
    Start-Job -ScriptBlock $_deployBlock01 -Name "test-job-$i" -ArgumentList $i
}

_waitForJobs

Write-Host "Get Job output"
#Recieve-Job will get the Write-Host output.
Get-Job | Receive-Job

_handleJobResults
```
